        Using the data from the https://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints, we would like from you to create 2 individual
        homeworks.

        1. The user should insert code of a regional bloc. From the response you get, show every country that has more
        than one
        and less than four alternative spellings ("altSpellings"). Use Promise with AJAX in the function where you
        should send
        the value from the inserted regional bloc and Promise in the function where you will get all the countries with
        specific
        number of alternative spellings defined above. Also provide solution with fetch() inside asynchronous function
        and await
        both request and function where you do the check and returns every countries with specific alternative
        spellings.

        2. The user should insert ISO 3166-1 2-letter country code. From the response you get, log every country name
        that has the
        same currency as the country from the response. Use Promise with AJAX in every function that you want to receive
        some
        response from the api-endpoints. Also provide solution with fetch() when you send requests. The function that
        supposed
        to log every country name should be asynchronous and you shall await the call for specific country data.
